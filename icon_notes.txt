// Wait, I can't easily generate PNGs in this environment without canvas binding.
// I will download placeholders or use a simple SVG to PNG converter?

// Let's create a simple HTML file that the user can open to "Generate Icons" or just use a placeholder from a public URL?
// No, I should not rely on external URLs for production assets.
// I'll create a script that uses updated `task.md` logic? No.
